To use this you must register for an api key at http://ipinfodb.com/register.php.

Once you have an api key you can add it by putting this line into your _config.php file.
GeoLocator::set_api_key('your_api_key');

If you are wanting dataobjects to have geolocation data then add this line to your _config.php.

Object::add_extension('dataobjectclassname', 'LocationObject');


Example use from inside a 'Controller'
//Get the IP Address
$ipaddress = $this->getRequest()->getIP();

//Get the geolocation dataobject for this address
$location = $this->getGeoLocation($ipaddress);

$obj = new exampleObject();

//NOTE currently the line below here does not work. The dataobject ends up with a "0" as the "LocationID".
$obj->LocationID = $location->ID;

$obj->write();
